## Donations
All our projects are free and open source software. You can download, use and
modify them without any charge, but the development and hosting of our projects
still requires time, code, more time and money. If you are able to make a
contribution, no matter what size,  we are able to continue the further
development and support of our software. In addition we would like to say thanks
to all people who have and are donating in any way to pwmt.org - We really
appreciate it!
