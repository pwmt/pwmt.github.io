Today we migrated our bug tracker from [MantisBT](http://mantisbt.org) to
[roundup](http://roundup-tracker.org) and changed its url to
[bugs.pwmt.org](http://bugs.pwmt.org). We hope that all issues, bug notes and
attachments have been moved successfuly, but we are afraid that we were not able
to migrate the passwords from the user accounts. Therefore we are sorry for
causing some inconvenience and kindly ask you to use the [password
reset](http://bugs.pwmt.org/user?@template=forgotten) function to restore your
password.
