Finally we are able to release the first stable version of
[zathura](/projects/zathura)  which is built upon [girara](/projects/girara) and
gives us the possibility to view other document types besides PDF. We have to
admit that it took us quite some time to finish this release, but we think that
it is worth it.

## Changelog

* Complete rewrite of zathura
* Uses the [girara](/projects/girara) interface library
* [Plugin system](/projects/zathura/plugins) for different document types
* Better [configuration](/projects/zathura/configuration)
* Quickmarks
