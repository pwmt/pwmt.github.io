Simultaneously to the new release of [zathura](/projects/zathura) we are happy
to present you the first version of [girara](/projects/girara).
[girara](/projects/girara) is a user interface library that focuses on
simplicity and minimalism. It is based on [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/), a cross-platform
widget toolkit, and serves as the user interface for both
[zathura](/projects/zathura) and [jumanji](/projects/jumanji).
