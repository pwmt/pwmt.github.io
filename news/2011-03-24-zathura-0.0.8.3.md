While the main development is happening in the girara branch of the zathura git
repository, we decided to release a new version of zathura in the meantime which
is still based upon the old code base and fixes several bugs:

## Changelog

* Updated text searching
* Support for poppler >= 0.15
* Fixed print command with multiple arguments
* Fixed GOptionEntries
* Updated Makefile
* Fixed several memory leaks
* Fixed segmentation faults

## Download
You can find the source of this version [here](/projects/zathura/download/).
